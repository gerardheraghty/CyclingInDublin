# CyclingInDublin
This repo contains an interesting project I conducted in analyzing cycling in Dublin city.

Using data provided by the CSO I initially analyzed cycling as a mode of transport to work, school, college, or childcare broken down by electoral division. 

I also conduced analysis on the usage of Dublin Bikes. Dublin Bikes is a bike sharing scheme in operation from bicycle docks and stations in Dublin City. Using the data provided by smart dublin (https://data.smartdublin.ie/dataset/dublinbikes-api) I was able to analyze the occupancy of the bike stations for each hour of the day. For the purpose of this project, I only performed the analysis on historical data for 2022.
